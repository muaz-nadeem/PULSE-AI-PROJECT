# Extension Icons

## Creating Icons

To add icons to the extension, create three PNG files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

## Quick Solution

You can use any online icon generator or create simple colored squares:

1. Create a 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixel PNG image
2. Use a simple design (e.g., a "P" for PULSE, or a productivity symbol)
3. Save them as `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, and `icon128.png` in this folder
4. Update `manifest.json` to include the icon paths again

## Temporary Workaround

The extension will work without icons - Chrome will show a default placeholder. The manifest.json has been updated to work without icons for now.
